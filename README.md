ABSTRACT

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability with symptoms that often overlap with other mental health disorders, making early and accurate diagnosis challenging. 
The primary objective of this study is to identify the most suitable model for a unique dataset that includes various attributes related to people as well as to achieve higher accuracies than existing models. 
Here, machine learning (ML) techniques are used to enhance ASD detection and classification. Using a diverse dataset with various demographic and health-related features, we employed 26 different Lazy Classifier
to measure performance in terms of accuracy, balanced accuracy, ROC AUC, F1 Score, and time taken. The highest accuracy of 83% was achieved by Passive Aggressive Classifier and Dummy Classifier, 
indicating the need for further analysis. We subsequently applied a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which only achieved 50% accuracy, underscoring the necessity for feature-dependent models
tailored to the dataset attributes. To improve accuracy and a more feature related result, 12 additional ML models were evaluated using confusion matrices, considering metrics like validation and training accuracies. 
Models such as Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Bagging Classifier achieved perfect scores (100%) across all metrics, demonstrating superior performance.
The study concludes that targeted ML models based on dataset-specific features significantly outperform general models like Lazy Classifier and CNN, providing more reliable and precise ASD detection. 
This work highlights the critical need for specialized models in handling diverse datasets to achieve optimal diagnostic accuracy.
